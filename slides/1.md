## Introduction to Redux

### Welcome
Welcome to the introduction to Redux. 

## Objective
We are going to talk about the motivation behind Redux and go over an example of a To-Do list to see how to use it. Then at the end to a small excercise for us to see how redux would look like when implemented.

### Why Redux?
As the requirements of single page applications have become increasingly complicated, our code must manage more state than ever before. This state can include server responses, cached data, as well as locally created data that has not yet been persisted to the server. UI state is also increasing in complexity, as we need to manage active routes, selected tabs, spinners, paginations, controls and so on.

Managing ever-changing state is hard. If a model can update another model, then a view can update a model, which updates another model, and this, in turn, might cause another view to update. At some point, you no longer understand what happens in your appp as you have lost control over the when, why and how of its state. When a system is opaque and non-deterministic, it's hard to reproduce bugs or add new features.

Managing state has become increasingly complex over time and what redux does is that it makes state mutations predictable by imposing restrictions on how and when updates happen.

### Objective of this session
* Go over the core concepts of the Redux library
