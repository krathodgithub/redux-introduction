## Introduction to Redux

### Objective of this session
* Go over the core concepts of the Redux library

### Three principles
* Single source of truth - Store

* State is read only
The only way to change the state is to emit an action

* Changes are made with pure functions
To specify how the state tree is transformed by actions, you write pure reducers
