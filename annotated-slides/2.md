## Core concepts

State

Imagine your app's state is described as a plain object. The state of a todo app might look like this:

```
{
  todos: [{
    text: 'Eat food',
    completed: true
  }, {
    text: 'Exercise',
    completed: false
  }],
  visibilityFilter: 'SHOW_COMPLETED'
}
```

This object is like a "model" except that there are not setters. This is so that different parts of the code can't change the state arbitrarily, causing hard-to-reproduce bugs.

Actions
```
{ type: 'ADD_TODO', text: 'Eat brownie' }
{ type: 'TOGGLE_TODO', index: 1 }
{ type: 'SET_VISIBILITY_FILTER', filter: 'SHOW_ALL' }
```
Enforcing that every change is described as an action lets us have a clear understanding of what's going on in the app. If something changed, we know why it changed. Actions are like breadcrumbs of what has happened.

Finally to tie state and actions together, we write a function called **reducer**. There's nothing magical about it, it's just a function that takes state and action as arguments, and returns the next state of the app. It would be hard to write such a function for a big app, so we write smaller functions managing parts of the state:

Reducers
```
function visibilityFilter(state = 'SHOW_ALL', action) {
  if (action.type === 'SET_VISIBILITY_FILTER') {
    return action.filter
  } else {
    return state
  }
}

function todos(state = [], action) {
  switch(action.type) {
    case 'ADD_TODO':
      return state.concat([{ text: action.text, completed: false }])
    case 'TOGGLE_TODO':
      return state.map(function(todo, index) {
        action.index === index ? { text: todo, completed: !todo.completed }
        : todo
      })
    default:
      return state
  }
}

function todoApp(state = {}, action) {
  return {
    todos: todos(state.todos, action),
    visibilityFilter: visibilityFilter(state.visibilityFilter, action)
  }
}

```
